# RogueEngine
Custom engine for roguelikes using libtcod. Entirely 'cause I'm too lazy to rewrite or copy a load of code for every new idea.

Currently limited to drawing on screen, a simple game loop, small debug bar and user input. User input is designed to be handled in classes implementing the 'Screen' abstact class. Very limited and a work in progress. Feedback is welcome if you're interested.

Things to implement:
	Sound
	TCODImages
	Reading/Writing save files
	Threading

Things to improve:
	Rendering
	Loop Time Management
