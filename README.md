# RogueEngine
Custom engine for roguelikes using libtcod. Entirely 'cause I'm too lazy to rewrite or copy a load of code for every new idea.

Currently limited to drawing on screen, a simple game loop, small debug bar and user input. User input is designed to be handled in classes implementing the 'Screen' abstact class. Very limited and a work in progress. Feedback is welcome if you're interested.

Things to implement:\n
	Sound\n
	TCODImages\n
	Reading/Writing save files\n
	Threading\n

Things to improve:
	Rendering
	Loop Time Management
